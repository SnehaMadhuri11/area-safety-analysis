# 🛡️ Area Safety Analysis

A Machine Learning and Data Analysis project to explore, visualize, and predict area safety using real survey data. This project was built as part of a hands-on workshop.

---

## 📊 Overview

This project uses Python to analyze a safety dataset, generate insightful charts, and build a basic predictive model. The goal is to understand how different features (like crime rate, lighting, patrolling, etc.) affect how safe an area is.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess area safety data
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize insights using various chart types
- Build a machine learning model to classify area safety
- Generate suggestions based on key safety features

---

## 🔍 Dataset

The dataset used is `area_safety.csv`, which includes survey responses about safety perceptions and environmental conditions in different localities.

## 📈 Visualizations

All EDA charts (bar plots, histograms, pie charts, heatmaps, etc.) are stored inside the `eda_charts/` folder. These visuals help understand the influence of individual features on safety levels.
